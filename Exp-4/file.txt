1. Set up a Git Repository
        =>Initialize a new Git repository:
            git init
        =>Clone an existing Git repository:
            git clone <repository_url>
2. Make Commits
        =>Stage files for commit (add specific files or all):
            git add <file_name>  # Add a specific file
            git add .            # Add all changes
        =>Commit changes with a message:
            git commit -m "Your commit message"
3. Work with Branches
        =>Create a new branch:
            git branch <branch_name>
        =>Switch to a branch:
            git checkout <branch_name>
        =>Create and switch to a new branch in one step:
            git checkout -b <branch_name>
        =>List all branches (local):
            git branch
        =>List all branches (remote and local):
            git branch -a
4. Merge Changes
        =>Merge changes from one branch into the current branch:
            git merge <branch_name>

Resolve conflicts (if any) and commit the merge.

5. Push Updates to a Remote Repository
        =>Push a branch to the remote repository:
            git push origin <branch_name>
        =>Push changes to the default branch (usually main or master):
            git push origin main
        =>Set upstream for the current branch (if not already set):
            git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
6. Use a .gitignore File
        =>Create a .gitignore file: This file should be placed at the root of your project.
        =>Example content for a .gitignore file:
            # Ignore node_modules
            node_modules/

            # Ignore log files
            *.log

            # Ignore temporary files
            *.tmp
        =>Ensure .gitignore is added to the repository:
            git add .gitignore
            git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
7. View Git History
        =>View the commit history:
            git log
        =>View a simplified log with one line per commit:
            git log --oneline
        =>View the history of a specific file:
            git log <file_name>
        =>View changes in the last commit:
            git show
8. Collaborate on a Project
        =>Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
            git pull origin <branch_name>
        =>Fork a repository (on GitHub) and clone it to your local machine:

        Go to the GitHub page of the repository.

        Click on Fork to create a copy in your account.

        =>Clone the forked repository:
            git clone <your_forked_repository_url>
        =>Push changes to your forked repository:
            git push origin <branch_name>
        =>Create a pull request (PR):
            After pushing your changes to your forked repository, go to GitHub and open a pull request to the original repository.

=>Example Workflow:
        =>Clone a repo:
            git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
            cd project
        =>Create a new branch:
            git checkout -b new-feature
            Make changes and stage them:
            git add .
        =>Commit the changes:
            git commit -m "Add new feature"
        =>Push the changes:
            git push origin new-feature
        =>Merge the feature branch to main:
        On GitHub or using a pull request, merge your feature branch into the main branch.
